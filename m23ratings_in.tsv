All these tracks (and other dark tracks I may have forgotten about) would vastly improve with some better lighting.			A track where all the characters are shrunk down inside of some sort of music room, and are driving across a bunch of different percussion instruments. I've even designed a layout once and tried making it, but I struggled to get it to load within Mariokart Wii, so I've tabled it for now.	4	It's a really great collection of custom tracks that really adds to the amount of content there is in Mariokart Wii, and it is a blast to play with friends. However, I can't give it a 5, since there's a surprising amount of bad tracks in the pack, and many are very awkward to play for more casual players, especially people that use karts. I've had to curate my own sublist of tracks within the pack that are the best to play with friends, as just picking randomly from the track selection usually ends up being unfun.

Add district 65, readd old n64 moo moo farm.	Hide and seek.  Online tt.	First off, I think that more energy should be put towards helping people get into custom track creation.  There are a lot of resources for helping with textures, modelling, kmp/kcl, etc. but at least I haven't been able to find more info on some of the more niche stuff, like whatever a vertex alpha is (riidefi has ghosted me) and a lot of the different lighting and decorating techniques.  I haven't been super blown away by any of the recent additions, and I think that making track creation more accessible would help with getting some more unique track designs being submitted.    Secondly, I think that there should be less of a focus on giving updates to currently existing tracks, and instead focus more on the new tracks being submitted.  I think that the updates should be publicly polled, and should only be accepted if there is a supermajority.  If the update is simply to fix bugs and/or give a visual overhaul, then make the poll options 'update' or to 'keep current version' (if the update is both to fix bugs and change gameplay/visuals, make another option that is to simply fix the bugs, but keep current visuals/gameplay).  If the update is to increase the track's shelf life in CTGP because it currently is not very popular, then make the poll options 'update' or 'remove'.  The majority of the time, at least I personally dislike the updates that are given to currently existing tracks in CTGP, and I usually would have preferred either a new track getting in and the track getting removed, or simply the track staying as-is.  Tell mrbean to put ads on chadsoft it would be funny and cost effective probably - i would laugh	"Rock Salt CANyon"	3	I played casually as long as I've been playing competitive, and so I just miss a lot of the older tracks and am not a fan of how some of them have been brought back.  I also just am not a big of a fan of the most recent updates.  We are in 2023, and the standards for CTGP are obviously a lot higher, but it feels like nearly every track is following the same formula, and so there isn't anything outstanding about many of them.  Maybe I misunderstand the situation, but I think that authors should be given more creative freedom with their tracks, as right now it feels like they might be trying to play it safe to please council.  I want to see some designs that don't need to be super tech heavy to be interesting and fresh.  Also competitive players complaining about balance are babies.  Ignore them.  The bigger the running/bagging track, the better (this is not always true, but stuff like green/sandcastle park and old colour wonderland were amusing).  Every track added in the past few years has tried to be pretty balanced while still defining the track as a running or bagging track.  I think some chaos would be nice for a change.

I'm going to be as upfront as possible because I could see some genuine changes being enforced to help in certain areas: - Admins should have better communication and transparency between each other. I'm not sure what happens in admin chat, but it is clear that there exist times where admins are not always on the same page. One of the more recent examples is with ghost-setting: Echo saying to do one thing while bento and Cotni say something else (ex: what the difficulty should be for certain tracks like Delfino Island; heck we don't even know what ghosts we're using). I think part of this issue is that Echo isn't the most active admin out there (don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for him, but sometimes I do question his presence as an admin versus playing in t3/t4 lounge). I totally understand that admins might be overwhelmed and busy, which is why I think there needs to be a fourth admin (I think admins mentioned a while back about adding a CT creator as an admin down the road?). If not, I would highly suggest having people help you guys out with simple tasks, such as updating the Backrooms sheet to reflect the most recent szs files and the most recent ghost times. Something like not acknowledging Flint's GBA LC update on the sheet for 4 months should not have flown by admins, and there should probably be some sort of system to track these updates. I am someone that believes in having things done in a timely fashion to reflect the situation of CT updates, and I think there needs to be more communication among ALL admins to ensure that this is done. This collectively transitions into the next point: - Being more direct / having improved guidelines. This may seem like a broad point, but I have also gotten the impression that admins are not as consistent and "strict" as they need to be in enforcing certain aspects. One specific example is ghost-setting. Last update, bento decided to give ghost-setters what ended up being a month extra to complete their ghosts, which made the distance between updates almost 5 months. We were under the impression that the update would include Bean's security fixes, but ultimately it was not added, and thus the long extension came from people not doing ghosts on time. It baffles me that people could not spend 15 minutes to complete an easy staff ghost, and that this was the primary cause of the update being extended outward. I would recommend admins encouraging people to set backup times early in the process, possibly assigning certain people to do backup ghosts. If the community found out that the longer-than-anticipated wait was because of a few people not doing ghosts, I'm sure they would be (reasonably) upset. The other major example I can think of is enforcing council strikes. I remember a couple weeks back when bento posted the theoretical number of strikes everyone would have, should they be enforced properly. It shocked me that some people would have received double-digit strikes. I understand missing a few assignments, but council is about committing to helping to improve tracks, and if people aren't willing to do that, then they should be striked, warned, and sternly talked to by admins. It's unfortunate that we barely got 2/3rds of council to vote on FR's GBA PC, as these reviews are ultimately to help the creator's track succeed. Deadlines should be deadlines; people shouldn't be let off the hook for submitting almost an entire day late when they had 3 weeks to complete a track review (albeit the track was short and simple). I'm glad we are getting to reflect on what we analyze for track reviews, and these sorts of discussions should be done more. tl;dr: admins should have clearer organization and standards when dealing with council strikes, ghost-setting, getting forms out in time (heck I had to ping admins to get this form out and bento "assumed" it was already done). - Improve variance in expert staff ghosts. As someone that has tested each and every update track on TTs, I do question some of the times admins create. A lot of the times seem "mid difficulty" since they seem to be around the average of ghostbusters submission times, but I think these should be used moreso as a reference for "should we make this track harder or easier than the average time? and by how much?". Even with this "hard update", there were no crazy difficult time ranges (as someone that beat all 10 update tracks' timeranges and/or ghost times); this kinda connects to the first point of Echo wanting ghosts to be "difficult" whereas bento and Cotni were not on the same page. After we had discussed keeping DKJ reasonable, oj wanted to make a much more difficult time without the permission of all three admins (only Echo agreed at first). My point is this: if admins create a more diversified range of ghosts for each update (ex: 1 easy, 3 easy/medium, 3 medium/hard, 2 difficult, 1 brutally difficult), then there would be less controversy about ghost setting times, especially since the difficulty of ghosts would cater to everyone (both casual and more experienced TTers). I feel like 80% of the recent ghosts have all been within the realm of "medium" difficulty; if you ask me I think every update should include at least one or two DS Mario Circuit difficulty ghosts (or easier) and at least one or two DBG/magmatic difficulty ghosts (or harder). I feel like you'd see less complaining if there was at least one or two ghosts that could be "accessible" to everyone. - I mentioned this in the second point, but actually enforcing council strikes on time; people aren't going to take the strike system seriously if they aren't enforced. - Introduce council polls. I think certain discussions we have in council (ex: do we review track X as a shadow submission since it was highly mentioned in this form) deserve to be voted on by council more often. One system that we could consider implementing is having a "ticket" system for submitting poll ideas (anonymously so that other council members don't know, similar to Lounge), and if admins approve of the suggestion, then we poll it. This doesn't have to be for just track reviewing, but even something like the recent question regarding the certain point in the Aqua Dungeon summary being addressed. - Have Council "events", such as Council wars. I think this could be a cool way to have people in Council interact and get to know others more while having some fun.  I have immense respect for admins, Bean, and our CTGP community, but I definitely think that work needs to be done.	I honestly couldn't tell you - I think the "dream" CT would be one that is visually gorgeous but also is super balanced gameplay-wise with a whole bunch of tech and shortcuts; I think the best tracks are those with the most action and chaos, but at the same time require strategy and track knowledge. As for themes, I honestly think the best tracks are the ones with the most unique themes; i.e., more than just a jungle or snow track (ex: Interstellar for a space-themed track, etc.). There are a lot of creators out there nowadays that have some really creative ideas.	4	CTGP as a whole has a strong base and continues to thrive all these years later; the only glaring issue I have is with portions of the community (which can be seen in any gaming community).

i know that many people in non-comp/author circles were quite unhappy with the structure of the secret track polls, with some authors feeling cheated out of it (of course, as a new track couldn't have EVER competed with an old nostalgia one). variety is the spice of life anyway, would be far more interesting to have a rotation regardless of what gets added. if i were to do it there would be one poll with older tracks, one without. seems like that would be a good compromise 	multiple mystuff packs (or even being able to have multiple tracks over the same slot somehow), ghost db unknown track naming feature actually working, being able to scroll cups on the bottom row as well as the top (lecode style basically)	structure is generally pretty good, but please actually track if people are not participating! there is no use having such a system if there is no accountability. 	i'll be making it later this year i hope	4	generally in a pretty good spot, plenty of good tracks are in and the systems in place to decide them are pretty decent as well. amongst authors there is still definitely work to be done with the system however, such as improved feedback and relations with authors (quite a few are deterred from the system currently, which obviously isn't very ideal). the sentiment of being surprised by a final result / response to a track, due to it not being brought up earlier when the opportunity for such feedback is in place, is still a very common complaint that ctgp gets very often. it would be worth making it even further of a priority to improve author relations, as the pack does not get a great rep currently, and without authors it couldn't exist at all! ofc working on overall community toxicity and moderation would go a long way with this as well, but while that should 100% be done, i know that it's not necessarily within ctgp's power to make all of those changes.  outside of that the main thing is really the bottleneck that ctgp development has become with bean as the only dev. opening it up to other trusted developers to add in features like author credits and coob, gamemodes like ott etc (all non-security ofc) would be a massive step for the pack and would help with larger unrest regarding a relative lack of features to some sp/le-code/etc distros. it would also make it easier for bean to pursue the long-awaited peaks update (and any other potential similar non-ctgp-critical projects). i know at some point a dev build was being worked on, might be worth having a bit more transparency on the status of that.

I have often offered my opinion in the surveys, but you have not changed your behavior in any way. Especially on holidays 2-3 weeks, I don't even see Pal and us people anymore, who I used to see often, and only some Japanese including me are doing ctww. What do you guys think of this reality? I guess you guys think it doesn't matter because you don't do ctwws. You can act on your desires, so when you ask me about my ideals, you just pretend to listen. And who do you guys value more, the ct lounge players or the players who mainly do CTWW? Custom tracks don't exist for course creators and lounges, and countil doesn't exist for course creators and lounges either, right? If that's the case, then I think we should listen to the opinions of those who are mainly concerned with ctww even more so. Anyway, first we should let the players who are stuck in the lounge do CTWW. Otherwise, we will be left with only about 20 players above mid level (8000vr) now.					54	79

Sandy Clocktower, bugsy's N64 Wario Stadium, Botania, Wiimmfi Wonder World, Strobenz Deserts (with updates ofc), Meteor Shower (when it doesn't have item disappearing bug), Gloomy Castle and Wacky Waterworks, CTR Hot Air Skyway, Molten Desert (without the sticky tricks on the road, honestly any EdwardJW track), Propeller Paradise. There are probably more but I'm forgetting them rn.	Removal of shroom glitch	Updates every other month have the best balance between avoiding stagnation with new content and not overloading with constant updates. That being said, it's hard to keep that pace when we don't accept very many tracks. Accepting both Cosmic Grove and Fort Francis was a major W.  Also, I disagree with the idea of removing stuff for the sake of "balance" as that leads to tracks playing more similarly and removes creativity and personality from the track. Sandy Clocktower ending cut is a perfect example of that, removing all of it would remove the charm of the track (I do understand removing the box variants as those could lead to actual issues).		4	The track quality overall is increasing, but I still think that standards are too high for acceptance. The average track over previous forms has less than 60% keep votes, yet we require about 66.7% keep votes to actually add stuff (close calls are debated). It seems strange to me at least that we hold submissions to a higher standard than stuff that's in as opposed to an equal standard.	Yes	Some days in a week	110	47

Petit Park hands down best ct ever made	3	One of the main things that I'm bummed that ctgp removed was being able to race aginst up to 3 ghosts in the regular tracks and you could only replay 4 ghosts on regular tracks and cts but you could race aginst up to 3 ghosts on the cts but not the regular tracks. Also I'm bummed that not every single retro track from other mario kart series are in ctgp and I would love to have all of them in. Some of the decsions to remove the tracks that didn't really have any bad thing about it was a losuy idea and it would have been better to remove the ones that are not good to play online and time trial, but their are many I could talk about. But overall ctgp is decent right now.	Yes	Some days in a week	161	25

I wish it was a sloping downhill hairpin turn because those slow ramps are very unfriendly.  castle of darkness - visual overhaul and maybe make some sections less blind.  concord town - great as it is, but maybe a visual update would increase the pick rate  gba lakeside park - visual update  gba cheese land - visual update  As a whole, adding more items per set for most of the tracks is needed (would gladly help and clarify which ones).	If the tracklist increases, project sanbo has a really nice cup layout: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5I3-vvNNBA	It seems to be operating well for the most part. I would suggest trying to look at scenarios from a wider lens. I'd look into doing quarterly ctgp track ratings or even every 2 months. I think being a bit radical with additions and removals to the pack is necessary because as stated before, the community/player activity would increase if frequent additions were made. Plus, the community could easily vote for a track to be removed if it gets added although come to find out, doesn't play the best.	As far as dream custom track, here's a list of ideas for ct creators:  - petite park remake without the bumpy road - funky kong themed track - northpole slide remake (although there's a plethora of snowy/ice tracks) - sequel tracks to (maybe replace) already existing cts to keep theming but just make a different layout      - wetland woods -> wetland marsh      - pianta shore -> pianta isle (i'm sure ct creators are more creative with ideas than i am haha)	2	I enjoy the gameplay aspects of ctgp. the tracks however, there's a ton of newer well designed tracks that should replace the older and unpolished ones, maybe even boring retros. ctgp is the biggest and most well known pack out there, so keeping players interested and maybe attracting new ones would mean keeping up with the quality of newer tracks that creators make. adding their tracks and removing older ones would most likely increase their motivation to either create or stay within the community (i stopped playing in 2018 then came back this year and it's a bit strange to see some old tracks still in alongside some amazing new ones like vile isle and northern heights; the cohesion in the pack isn't really there to showcase that ctgp is the biggest ct pack for a reason).

CTGP CLASSIC  I'm aware 24P and Time Trials Online work is important, but please listen to the old players and give us a revival of 1.02 or early 1.03 CTGP, exactly the way it was (with all the new features added to the pack if you wish too). I beg of you, many others beg of you, it's what the community wants. 	Nope, not my business to tell you how to operate. 	CTGP CLASSIC TRACKS	2	First reason is many tracks added have insane tech or shroomless shortcuts that are vital to getting a good spot. Second reason is because the vast majority of new tracks added to CTGP have cannons. To provide an example, Terra Ursae has no cannon and no overly complicated strats, and it's widely regarded as the best track added in the last update.	No	Most days in a week	151	49

I'd look to all of those and there's pretty clear reasons playing them mostly		I'd rather just council take the blame for tracks being received bad way before authors. That would literally fix so much, since authors have very little control of their tracks or how the community sees them currently	Garden of Dreams 👍	2	Retros are definitely killing the pack and interest for a lot of authors. Also if people heard what council felt a lot of the time behind it all, I think there'd be a lot more upset people. I think it's not the worst, but could be so much better if the removal poll and updates were done different and either comp or casual split, cause both are aligned against each other. It's draining, a waste of time and results in many people distancing or quitting (players and authors both).	No	Multiple times a month	74	92

Comp very much has its own metagame that rarely aligns with the ambitious designs authors opt for, leading to unforseen and inconsistent decisions.  So, I recommend two changes:  1. Figure out what these comp expectations are, and articulate that on the track wishlist, so creators know what they are getting into upfront. 2. Add a new way for tracks to be accepted, in addition to the regular vote. For example, tracks could also be accepted if a large majority of either casual or comp players vote for it (>90% maybe).  Comp preferences are very often presented as objective fixes in track summaries, and it isn't fair to pressure authors into pandering to what is essentially a vocal minority. They should be able to make the tracks they want, taking the chances they want, and still have a way to get realistically accepted.  If creators want to appeal to comp that is okay too obviously, but it should never feel like a requirement. The system needs to be transparent, and friction between casuals and comps needs to be minimized. Thank you.	A focus on gameplay and unique theming, allowed to take chances on ambitious ideas.	3	CTGP has made great strides recently, especially with track removals. However, I think a lot could still be done for acceptances. I do not think the current system is particularly encouraging or fair for CT creators.	Yes	Once a month or less	67	99

CTGP is great but needs to scrap the 250 track limit so that some good tracks don't get booted out. The limit used to be a good thing but the quality of CTs is so high now it would be nice to have more than 250. With the limit it's impossible to add the new tracks while keeping the classics.

Makes gameplay more interesting imo. Blissful Block is a huge example of that and should be (re)considered(?) (idk it’s situation)			I have so many ideas in my head for track overhauls and remakes and new tracks. I already mentioned dynamics above. One idea I have is to recreate blue loop. It starts in an underwater section, and the first turn leads into a cave and that second straight brings the player up above sea level directly into the back of a house in that zig-zag section. The next straight is on an isolated island. The next turn leads to a boardwalk which immediately drops the player back under water. The underwater section extends in the section of u-turns. 	4		No	Most days in a week	143	26

I also feel like they should consider if there's too many shroomless cuts or regular shortcuts on a track making it one sided ruining the fun. 	Something like Twin Peaks. I like the idea of having to dodge something every lap on certain parts of the track as a gimmick. I would like if there was 2-3 shortcuts that aren't much faster or slower than the other(s) by much.	3	CTGP at the moment is ok. I haven't really been excited or demotivated to play the game based of it's tracks and other features such as countdown or knockout. I know when I play ctwws, it's better than the people who are always picking the same 20-30 tracks in comp because there's not much track variety.	No	Most days in a week	63	54

It continually pains me to see better tracks get removed in updates because the leading people behind this pack outright refuse to remove or even update any of MrBean's old tracks no matter how graphically outdated and terribly designed they are. The overall quality of CTGP will NEVER reach its full potential until these relic tracks have been dealt with in some way, be it updating them to fix their terrible design flaws and outdated visuals or just removing them outright until the former happens, but CTGP overall is still very fun to play weekly as a content creator and the quality of new track additions is only going up.

Add an option that lets the game automatically and gradually speed up the music when entering lap 3, instead of switching to the lap 3 brstm. This would prevent the music from cutting off and starting again from the beginning, exactly like on Countdown mode when the timer hits 45 seconds left, which would be really useful for people who use long songs as brstms and it would no longer be necessary to make lap 3 brstms when building music packs, speeding up the process considerably. It could be even possible to choose the rate at which the music should speed up, for example 3%, 5%, 10%, 20%. This could be toggled ON/OFF. 2. An option that lets you see the position indicator even after finishing a race. This could be useful in case lag starts happen. This could be toggled ON/OFF in the CTGP settings. 3. This one is a little more silly, but still pretty cool imo. Add an option (that can be toggled ON/OFF) that makes your position indicator flash red, like in KO mode, if you're currently in a spot that would make you lose 100 or more VR in a ww/ctww, and flash green if you're currently in a spot that would make you gain 100 or more VR in a ww/ctww. 4. Make it possible to keep spectating a ww/ctww, without actually having to play after the race is done. Add a "Spectate" button when joining a friend who's in a worldwide/ctww, just like when a friend is hosting a friend room. This spectator mode could be like the one in friend rooms where you can actually see the placement indicator and item indicator of the player you're spectating. 5. Ground golden mushrooms should give you a longer boost that a regular mushroom when picked up 6. If several people are trying to join a single friendroom at once, instead of making the process completely random make it so the first to click "join friend" will be the first to get in, the second to click "join friend" will be the second to get in the room and so on 7. If possible, allow CTGP to hold more than 250 tracks at once, maybe 350 or 500?  8. Online time trial mode 9. Allow 200cc, item rain or other gimmicks to be chosen in ctwws, maybe with a very low chance such as 3% or 5%, or with a vote similar to the usual track vote 10. Allow the VR in ctwws to go beyond 9999		Mushroom Peaks	5		No	Most days in a week	143	14

I also want to see Petite Park back in CTGP.	I would like the ability to have multiple custom layouts. Within layout creation, I would also like the ability to create a custom layout by subtraction, particularly if someone only wants to remove a few tracks (i.e: all tracks - CTL banned tracks). This would also allow someone to more easily make a roughly normal cup layout with their desired hidden tracks.

For some time now I always thought it would be really fun if a custom track played more with verticality.   Since the checkpoints of the checkpoint system don't have a vertical limit you could abuse this for some really interesting setups.  Like have multiple vertical levels for one track where one would have opportunities to get up to a higher lever and obstacles with the risk of falling down to a lower one.  Another Idea would be to have multiple laps with drastically different layouts by having multiple copies of the same map vertically stacked ontop of each other and at the end of one lap you would somehow end up in a differnet copy of the track. If someone could pull of that illusion convincingly it would be one of the coolest gimmicks in any Mario Kart track ever. 	3	The quality of CTs has gone drastically up over the years, especially in the last few. I am mostly really happy with the selection and quality of the tracks.  The biggest obstacle to me playing more CTGP is honestly the inconvenience of having to use my real Wii to play.   Switching Video inputs for my Wii. switching what my GCs connected too, having to boot up both the console, MKW itself and connecting to Wiimfi takes multiple minutes. And it would take even longer and would be even more inconvenient if I didn't play it through my capture card. And thats not even considering setting up a friend room or trying to join world wides. Which will can take a very long time.  Friend rooms in general are extremely bothersome to organize. Basically the only time I play in friendrooms is the when I join in Mr Beans friend rooms when he streams. Otherwise my only option is to play WWs / CTWWs. That is if I don't want to spend hours trying to organize stuff via discord, which would be exhausting.  If I compare this to something like SSBM Netplay via Slippy there is a stark contrast. With Slippy I can boot up the game with one mouse click, get into queue within 5 seconds after I clicked and most of the time get into a game within less than a minute.  If the process of starting a session of MKW were more like that I would imagine that not just me but many people would play MKW way more regularly and get more easily into it.

I don't enjoy playing a track where my only chance of getting a middle spot at most is by getting a Bullet Bill.	I'm still waiting for track author credits in game. The Skill Issue Pack includes this feature, and it is a useful part in appreciating creators' work and simultaneously understanding the track list. As a creator, I want myself and others to receive the recognition they deserve for making these tracks. Please implement this feature soon.  CTGP's track selection menu needs a rework. Only 6 cups are visible at a time, and to see more, the arrows can only be accessed while in the top row. It's clumsy to do this routine every time I want to browse what tracks are available and where they are. Most other modpacks show at least 8 cups at a time and have arrows that work intuitively.  Another change to improve track visibility is to implement track preview images. To some extent, every Mario Kart game provides a track preview when selecting it. It helps people visually recognize the track and associate that preview with its name. However, it's the standard in MKW modpacks to have a blank background when highlighting tracks. I find this confusing. Often tracks have similar names that make it confusing to find the one you're looking for. For example, if you're wanting to choose Citrus' CT jungle track with waterfalls and can't remember the name, how can you find it from Jungle Cliff, Jungle Glade, Jungle Jamble, & Jungle Ruins? It just isn't intuitive to guess by name and eventually figure out that Jungle Glade is the one you're looking for. A noclip screenshot for every track would help immensely in navigating 250 tracks. The only roadblock (beside the technical end) is that each track update would require more effort to produce, but I am confident that this will ease players into the track list better and make it accessible to someone who plays infrequently.	Make propaganda images to encourage more track testing (WIP threads, online tests, & upcoming tracks).	The track takes place on a bowl of mashed potatoes. Each driver is covered in butter, and as they drive, the surfaces they traverse become more slippery. If the race doesn't end by a certain time, a goblin eats the entire bowl, drivers included, and the Wii disc drive consumes the Mario Kart Wii disc.	2	As a CT creator with declining interest in MKW, take my opinion for what you will.  I feel that CTGP is treading water. Bean's current actions are maintaining current code and ghost database infrastructure, developing 24-player mode (which appears to have stalled and will offer no impact on people who aren't streamers), and adding track updates every couple of months. These result in a stable distribution with an occasional track update every so often. This relatively unchanging state is what I imagine makes CTGP appealing for a lot of the community, but to me, it highlights what I dislike in the pack.  I am ultimately not interested in many tracks in the pack. Multiple popular online tracks are ones I have no interest in. Mushroom Peaks is the easy one to point out since it is the most popular, but a couple other consistent top 20 tracks are ones I have no interest in playing. Retro tracks take up a sizable portion of the track list, and they offer little appeal to me in this game. I find they often are more compelling in their original games. I would rather have more room for new CT experiences that I cannot get elsewhere. Even with plenty of solid new tracks, they barely alter what is and has been the CTGP experience that I've grown increasingly negative to.  How I view it is that CTGP sets the technical standards for what creators can design, and it is disappointing having no new features for the pack. Any creator that wants their content to have potentially high play counts needs to be in CTGP and meet its standards of base MKW tracks with the occasional consideration of 200cc. As a creator, I think this is limiting what the community produces. None of the ambitious ideas possible with LE-code (or its alternatives), sound triggers, or a fully fledged battle mode are really explored because CTGP doesn't support it. I believe that CTGP needs more technical possibilities to showcase new ideas and facilitate the creation of new ones. Only having 24-player mode in the pipeline for significant new content does not fundamentally impact what people can create.  These are my thoughts on CTGP's current state. I'm sure my experiences and expectations differ from the typical player, but hopefully there's something you find worth considering for CTGP's future.	No	Once a month or less	32	130

The top 3 suggested tracks for addition should be shadow reviewed by council.	N/A	4	The pack itself is great. It's in a much better state than it was when I first joined council in 2021. The removal polls were such a big step in the right direction and removed a lot of the tracks that I felt were holding back CTGP from a casual and creator standpoint. IMO, there's still a couple problematic tracks that drive newcomers away that should seriously be addressed. I understand very well that it's something that's not in council's hands, but it does affect the state of the pack as a whole and plays into my rating. 	No	Daily	169	22

If certain custom track creators publicly voice apathy or mockery of the physical negative reactions that some have towards the effects in their tracks (Broken Pier is what I mean of course) then the track should definitely not be in the pack.   Would it be possible for the Council to provide... video support of their feedback for tracks that were rejected? Maybe not always in a public form, but preferably so.	Very difficult question, considering Sakura Sanctuary exists.  Something that can be actually balanced in online races, along the likes of Desert Fort and Banished Keep. Those tracks both have intuitive shortcuts and excellent appearance.

Try to stick to a theming and colour scheme, like the majority of rainbow roads look ugly imo (even the wii one) I'll let them slide because it's rr, but don't do that on a non rr track. Also be careful with sticky road u need it so people don't fly 1000miles into the air but don't make it like melting magma meelee uphill section.	4	I mean the ghost database is the greatest feature ever added to ctgp icl, only if service pack had that would I switch over fully, the new track updates normally contain mainly good tracks, some shitters defo get added but you can't please everyone, although I see a lot of long time players complain about some of the same tracks and I think comp players should be listened to more than casuals, and thats coming from me who will rarely go near a ct in an online format, I just get the annoyance from others.

Currently I have little to nothing wrong with it, but I have more fun playing other CT packs such as Mario Kart Midnight, and have been playing those packs more than CTGP these past few months whenever I want to play custom tracks.  I'm pretty light when it comes to my opinions on tracks, and there's very few I'd say I dislike, not just tracks in CTGP, but when it comes to all the custom tracks released. I don't set my expectations high when playing a track for the first time, and having created several tracks myself, I know the process isn't very easy. Both of these help me find at least something of value in most tracks I play, and it makes it pretty difficult for me to say any negative comments about a custom track unless it is something more objective. (if it's impossible to complete part of the track for example) It's quite a bit of the reason why most of my votes were Keep or Indifferent, though most if not all the tracks I put Remove for, I don't dislike them very much. I guess they're more so my picks for tracks to be removed if I decided that.  I'm pretty indifferent to retros being in the pack as a whole. I enjoy playing some of them, but wouldn't be bummed if most of them were removed or something, as I tend to enjoy original designs a bit more. I think what I enjoy most from tracks is different from most people, I was thinking about this this morning, but a track like Dash Cannon Woods I enjoy more than various modern tracks that have more polished visuals. I think it has some charm to it, and I like the unique gameplay of it compared to other tracks. Though I'm not saying I dislike all "good looking tracks" because that'd be stupid and incorrect to say, I just care more about the gameplay and little glimpses of personality in a course. FFFF is a recent track that I think is good in visuals, gameplay, and charm, for example, and I'm excited to see that one in CTGP because it was my favorite from the CT Jam it comes from (PF from the same jam is quite cool too!)

Rainbow Road Solar also needs a major update to fix the moon section, rolling chain chomps, the rotating tunnel and make the uphill before the last turn a little less sharp. (the triple ramps near the beginning could also use a fix since it's quite easy to overshoot them and fall off if you're in a star or shroom boost). The turnskip on GCN Dino Dino Jungle is completely unnecessary and ruins the retro feeling of the track as there's no reason for it to be there. There is no need to bring in "CT meta" unintended looking shortcuts to retros which didn't have those cuts in the original game.	Online TTs, Online battle mode with custom CTGP battle courses, QOL features which are present in a lot of other CT packs (there are too many to list off the top of my head but in Skill Issue Pack and MKSP there are a lot of QOL menu features that would be very beneficial in CTGP)		Anything that functions as an actual race track, has player interaction, doesn't have unnecessary jank cuts that save insane amounts of time and eventually becomes the main route, doesn't look like it was made by a 5 year old on MS Paint, doesn't have blatant design flaws such as blind holes or solid walls in the middle of the track and finally a track that is simple to know where you need to go from the first playthough and where it's not easy to get lost or go the wrong way.	2	The current "meta" of original CT designs really hinders the growth of the community and prevents new players from getting into CTs and improving. Despite there being around 150 original CTs in the pack, it's always the same 30 or so old ones with massive design flaws and unnecessary broken cuts and tricks that get picked in competitive CTs. There are a lot of actual well designed tracks that don't see the light of day in competitive because experienced players deem them to be "boring" because they don't have a funny TF input spindrift hop trick shroomless cut that saves 10 seconds. With that said, new players and existing RT mains who are looking to get into CTs competitively end up giving up and being unmotivated to learn a shitty jank abusing shortcuts in 100 tracks and this lack of influx of new players is what is killing competitive CTs (CT mains complain in Lounge about their being no activity and I think bad/outdated track design is the biggest culprit). Another minor issue is that most original designs are unnecessarily long, with about 20 or so tracks in the pack being over 3:30/4 minutes long (the longest RT is about 2:45ish long) and probably over 80% of them are longer than rBC. There is no need for tracks to be that long, it just demotivates players from TTing and practicing them.	No	Some days in a week	83	79

I'd like to see some retro track remakes that feel fresh and aren't just the mk8 style. The only track I can immediately think of that needs fixed is Yoshi Lagoon - and the only way to fix it is to just remove it.	Like I said before, I'd like to have more singleplayer stuff. I'd also like to have the ability to enable/disable stuff in friend rooms through messages, like getting to pick a team color if its a team race, being able to have 200cc as a possible cc class to get in CTGP Worldwides, more stuff like that for regular CTWWs or just singleplayer.  Oh, and fix the background aspect ratio in the CTGP Channel. That annoys me and I don't know why but it does.	Please accept one of my custom tracks one day	I'd really like to make a custom track based on building stuff out of toys and such. But I'll probably make the track myself	3	As a CTGP player, I enjoy the fun and chaotic options you can use for playing. Countdown alone will always be both extremely fun and extremely impressive to just create an entirely new game mode basically from scratch. Item rain with all items can land is a hectic blast, and the possibly unintended thing where you can play battle mode on any custom track is really funny.  The problem I have with some of these features is that you can't play them alone. I don't usually have a large group of people who can or want to use CTGP for funrooms, so there's a lot of stuff I just can't do. Countdown only really gets active on Saturday mornings, KO mode is only something I get to experience when someone else is streaming one, other from that, I can't play them in singleplayer. Even if the CPUs don't act different, it would still be fun to have the option.   Now, as a newer CT creator, half of this pack feels like an insult. So many tracks are full of unfinished bugs and jank parts that makes the requirements given by council feel like double standards at times. It only makes things worse when you hear that jank and bad sections of a track are the reason they're still in the pack. Glimmer Express Trains has a part at the beginning where you can just drive through a small triangle and do a pretty significant shortcut. The Alfaro noodle section of Star Slope is borderline impossible to drive on. Yoshi Lagoon is just a problem entirely. The thought that I have to abide by rules that tracks in the pack are allowed to stay... it's pretty demoralizing. I'd imagine there will be a point where I  just won't bother submitting tracks because I know it won't get in for unfair reasons.	No	Most days in a week	60	58

Most unique tracks are either you love them or you hate them, so it will be easier for them to get removed as a result of this system. 	Something that has some difficult strats, unique visuals (not the lazy mk8 themed ones), and plays well online for people who know the strats and don't. 	1	Track Council keeps removing unique tracks and adding in ones that aren't unique and/or are very forgettable (ex: ice cream fortress, lost ruins, terra ursae, magmatic sanctuary, obstagoon's palace, mystic tangle, sandstone cliffs, musical cliff, envenom snowstorm, vile isl, volcano canyon, should I continue?). This results in a very stale pack with minimal depth in comparison to the depth it once had. Everything is so basic and follows the same visual pattern, there has to be a 2 second grass cut, and there are double flip flat ramps everywhere (which I would like to mention that there are only 4 flat ramps in the original game with 2 being part of shortcuts and only 6 double flip ramps in the game with 2 on RR, 2 on rWS, 1 on KC, and 1 on rDS). There is no rush to get tracks in the pack, just wait for the good ones to be released so that updates are good instead of mid or bad. We saw what happened in late 2020-2021 with terrible tracks making it in and lots of unique tracks getting removed. This is exactly what happens when you rush through updates instead of choosing only the best tracks to get in.	No	Most days in a week	165	30

For example, more decision about the default cup organization would make the pack much less random feeling. Or more discussion on how different groups of tracks can cover each others strengths and weaknesses, or how they can reinforce an overarching weakness that could be addressed by communicating a request for a track to fill cover it.
