All these tracks (and other dark tracks I may have forgotten about) would vastly improve with some better lighting.			A track where all the characters are shrunk down inside of some sort of music room, and are driving across a bunch of different percussion instruments. I've even designed a layout once and tried making it, but I struggled to get it to load within Mariokart Wii, so I've tabled it for now.	4	It's a really great collection of custom tracks that really adds to the amount of content there is in Mariokart Wii, and it is a blast to play with friends. However, I can't give it a 5, since there's a surprising amount of bad tracks in the pack, and many are very awkward to play for more casual players, especially people that use karts. I've had to curate my own sublist of tracks within the pack that are the best to play with friends, as just picking randomly from the track selection usually ends up being unfun.
